This project was built with the intention of learning the basic concepts of the React.js library. 

This project covers the concepts of react such as: 

- Custom Class Components and Simple Components which involves nesting of these two.
- props, to pass the data to our child component.
- state, to manipulate those data (such as removing and adding items) without storing it in a database.
